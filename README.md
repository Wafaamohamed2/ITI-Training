# ITI Training Tasks :
     This repository contains a series of hands-on C# projects and exercises developed during my training at the Information Technology Institute (ITI).
     Each folder focuses on a specific topic or concept, showcasing practical implementations and code structure.

     
## Tasks Details:

  ###  **Day1**:
       Purpose:- Learn C# syntax basics and console applications.
       Key concepts:- Variables, data types, `Console.WriteLine` and `ReadLine`.
       
  ###  **Day2**:
        Purpose:- Introduce object-oriented structure.
        Key concepts:- Class design, constructors, encapsulation.
  
  ###  **Day3**:
          Purpose:- Dive deeper into OOP.
          Key concepts:- Inheritance hierarchies, interfaces, method overriding.
          
  ###  **ClassLibrary1**:
         Purpose:- Provide a shared library of common utilities.
         Usage:- Imported into other projects (e.g., Day2...) for reuse        

  ###  **ITI-Day4**:
          Purpose:- Handle runtime errors gracefully.
          Key concepts:- Exception handling with `try`, `catch`, `finally`, defining custom exception types.

  ###  **Day7 – Bubble Sort with Delegates**:
         Purpose:- Implement generic sorting logic using delegates.
         Highlights:- 1- `Compare` delegate to inject comparison logic.
                      2- Anonymous methods for ascending/descending sort.
                      3- Tracing output for each pass and swap in Bubble Sort.

  ###  **Day7-part2 – Thermostat with Events**:
         Purpose:- Build event-driven logic in C#.
         Highlights:- 1- `Thermostat` class with `OnTemperatureChanged` event .  "publisher"
                      2- `Heater` and `Cooler` classes respond based on threshold. "Subscriber" 
                      3- Demonstrates loose coupling and real-world event usage.

  ###  **Day9**:
         Purpose:- Learn LINQ for data querying in C#.
         Key concepts:- LINQ syntax, query expressions, filtering, and grouping data.

  ###   **Day10**:
         Purpose:- Implement file input/output operations in C#.
         Key concepts:- Reading/writing files, StreamReader/StreamWriter, handling file exceptions.
               

##  Learning Objectives:
       - Understand fundamental and advanced OOP principles.
       - Practice exception handling techniques.
       - Explore delegate-based programming and event-driven architecture.
       - Learn to structure reusable code via libraries.
